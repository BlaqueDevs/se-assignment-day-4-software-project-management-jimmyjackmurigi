## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile is flexible and good for fast changes, while Waterfall follows a step-by-step plan. Agile is great for updates and user feedback but it can be messy. Waterfall is clear and structured but slow to adapt
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile works best for projects that need quick changes, like mobile apps, while Waterfall is better for stable projects like banking software.
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Quality assurance keeps software working well and prevents errors. Teams test often, review code, and follow best practices to maintain high standards 
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining project scope keeps work on track by setting clear goals. A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) splits work into small tasks, making planning easier

The software solves problems like slow workflows or missing features. These issues matter because they affect users' time and productivity.
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
Clearly defining the problem helps teams build software that actually solves user needs instead of guessing what works.
## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
The software is a simple, smart solution that makes life easier for users without extra hassle.
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out? 
The software stands out because it has key features that solve problems better or faster than others.
## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
Market data shows how many people need the software and if it’s growing, which helps with planning. 
## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your software’s positioning and development?
Knowing market trends helps position the software by focusing on what users want and making better decisions.
